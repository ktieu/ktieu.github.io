<h1>Futurama</h1>
<i><b>Magic Motorways</b></i><br>
Norman Bel Geddes<br>
Random House, 1940<br>

Futurama of the General Motors Highways and Horizons Exhibit at 1939 New York World's Fair.

"...visual dramatization of a solution to the complex tangle of American roadways."  Showed examples of motorway across all types of terrains such as mountains and rivers.

Four Basic Principles of Highway Design:
<ol>
<li>safety
<li>comfort
<li>speed
<li>economy
</ol>

Geddes goal is to make collisions impossible and to eliminate congestion.

"The book is a description of the exhibit, just as the exhibit is an illustration of this text."  The book explains the reasoning behind the exhibit.

Merritt Parkway and Highway 17 Santa Cruz as existing good examples of highway design.

"...arbitrarily dated ahead to 1960---twenty years from now."  Geddes claims magic motorways could already be build in 1940 in terms of contemporary engineering.

32,400/year auto deaths.  Similar to today!

Geddes says that for traffic congestion, infrastructure is the problem, not cars, nor the number of cars.  He says highways design is inefficient.  The main reason is that when cars replaced horses, the original horseways, although improved, were not fundamentally changed for cars.  Need to build roads specifically designed for autos.
