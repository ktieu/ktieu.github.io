<h1>Optimization</h1>

<p>
Optimization can be viewed as the process of finding the best action to a decision problem.
</p>

<h1>Discrete Decision</h1>

<h2>Pandemic Example</h2>
<p>
Consider a pandemic, where although asymptomatic, you
have tested positive for the disease.  Your decision problem is to decide
between two actions: \( A \) (do nothing), or \( B \) (seek treatment).  The results of your
action are distinguish by losses associated with the four possibilities:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>clean</th><th>infected</th></tr>
<tr><td>\( A \)</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
<tr><td>\( B \)</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.3</td>
</table>

<p>
Intuitively, if you are likely to be infected given a positive test, then seeking treatment
makes sense.  On the contrary, if it is still unlikely that you are infected, then the best
thing to do is probably nothing.  In fact, from the table above, it is obvious that if you
are infected, then doing nothing incurs a larger cost; simiarly, if you are clean, then
seeking treatment has a larger cost.
</p>

<h2>Formalization</h2>

<p>
To formalize the decision problem, we associate a single, numerical cost with each action \( f(\cdot) \), and
then optimize by choosing an action with minimum cost.
</p>

<p>
For convenience we define the cost of an action as the expected loss based on the table above:

\[ \begin{align}
f(A) & = 0 \cdot P(\textrm{clean | positive}) + 1 \cdot P(\textrm{infected | positive}) \\
f(B) & = 0.1 \cdot P(\textrm{clean | positive}) + 0.3 \cdot P(\textrm{infected | positive})
\end{align} \]
</p>

<p>
Assume that the prior probability of infection is very low, while the true and false positive rates are high and low, respectively:

\[ \begin{align}
P(\textrm{infected}) &= 0.0001 \\
P(\textrm{positive} | \textrm{infected}) &= 0.95 \\
P(\textrm{positive} | \textrm{clean}) &= 0.01
\end{align}
\]
</p>

<h2>Bayes's Rule</h2>

With Bayes's Rule, we can calculate the posterior probability of being infected
given a positive test result:

\[ \begin{align}
P(\textrm{infected | positive}) &= \frac{P(\textrm{positive | infected}) P(\textrm{infected})}{P(\textrm{positive})} \\
&= \frac{P(\textrm{positive, infected})}{P(\textrm{positive, infected}) + P(\textrm{positive, clean})} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{P(\textrm{positive, clean})}{P(\textrm{positive, infected})}} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{0.009999}{0.000095}} \\
&= 0.009412
\end{align} \]

<h2>Optimal Decision</h2>

<p>
The costs can now be computed:
\[ \begin{align}
f(A) & = 0 \cdot (1 - 0.009412) + 1 \cdot 0.009412 = 0.009412 \\
f(B) & = 0.1 \cdot (1 - 0.009412) + 0.3 \cdot 0.009412 = 0.1019
\end{align} \]
</p>

Thus, the optimal action is \( A \) (do nothing).  The reason that \( f(A) \) is much lower than \( f(B) \) is because
the posterior probability of infection given a positive test result is still low, less than one percent.  And the
reason that this probability is low despite a positive test is because the prior probability of infection is a very low \( 10^{-4} \).
