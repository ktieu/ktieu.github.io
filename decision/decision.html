<h1>Decision Theory</h1>
Free will is the ability to control one's actions.  The philosophical question on free will is whether we have it or not.

Assuming we can control our actions, the engineering question is then how should we do it.  This is answered by decision theory.

Imagine that you are at a birthday party, and that there is ice cream for dessert with two choices: vanilla or chocolate.
Which flavor should you choose?  That of course depends on your preferences.  If you are indifferent, then it doesn't matter which flavor you choose.
However, if you prefer vanilla over chocolate, then you choose vanilla.  A convenient way to model this situation is to say that you have two actions:
<ol>
<li>\(a_1\) for vanilla
<li>\(a_2\) for chocolate
</ol>
and that with each choice comes a cost (e.g., disappointment) so:
<ol>
<li>\(c_1 = g(a_1) = 0\) for vanilla
<li>\(c_2 = g(a_2) = 1\) for chocolate
</ol>
where \(g\) is the cost function for an action.
Then the best choice is the one with minimum cost, namely \(a_1\) because \(c_1 \le c_2 \).  So the optimal control decision rule is,
\[ u^* = \arg \min_a g(a) \]
In our case \(u^* = a_1\) because \(a_1\) is the argument \(a\) in the above equation which gives the minimum cost \(g(a)\).

<h2>Uncertainty</h2>
[Need an example with prior probabilities of states of nature only, and then add experiment to obtain posterior on state of nature].

Statistics can be viewed as the study of choosing actions under uncertainty.

<h2>Sequential Actions</h2>
