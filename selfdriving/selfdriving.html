<h1>Futurama</h1>
<i><b>Magic Motorways</b></i><br>
Norman Bel Geddes<br>
Random House, 1940<br>

Futurama of the General Motors Highways and Horizons Exhibit at 1939 New York World's Fair.

"...visual dramatization of a solution to the complex tangle of American roadways."  Showed examples of motorway across all types of terrains such as mountains and rivers.

Four Basic Principles of Highway Design:
<ol>
<li>safety
<li>comfort
<li>speed
<li>economy
</ol>

Geddes goal is to make collisions impossible and to eliminate congestion.

"The book is a description of the exhibit, just as the exhibit is an illustration of this text."  The book explains the reasoning behind the exhibit.

Merritt Parkway and Highway 17 Santa Cruz as existing good examples of highway design.

"...arbitrarily dated ahead to 1960---twenty years from now."  Geddes claims magic motorways could already be build in 1940 in terms of contemporary engineering.

32,400/year auto deaths.  Similar to today!

Geddes says that for traffic congestion, infrastructure is the problem, not cars, nor the number of cars.  He says highways design is inefficient.  The main reason is that when cars replaced horses, the original horseways, although improved, were not fundamentally changed for cars.  Need to build roads specifically designed for autos.

The word "highway" comes from roads naturally laid on ridges.

Railroads are a good example of good design of road to vehicle.  Turnpikes and toll roads were attempts to design roads for cars.  Holland Tunnel is good example of traffic separation: traveling direction, pedestrains, etc.

Car safety technology has improved, but the human driver has not.  Human distraction is the critical factor.  There is also the reaction time required.  Many road signs are implemented to aid the human driver, so why not do the same but in a more adapted way for autonomous vehicles?

stop and yield says what to do
speed limit says how to drive
right turn only determines path
also many environmental information signs such as bump, divided highway, etc.

Vehicle-to-vehicle communication and infrastructure works for trains and planes, but is that because there are a lot fewer of these vehicles than cars?  Also they are operated by trained drivers.

Clover-leaf combines the advantages of over(under)-passes and rotaries.
